# NPC Police and Traffic Modifications
FiveM NPC Police and DLC cars spawn in traffic

If you do not want to use popgroups which adds DLC cars (up to 2699), delete popgroups.meta from /data after downloading, cfx will skip it

If you know how to edit the fxmanifest, you can remove popgroups from there also

If you know how to edit popgroups.meta to add the new cars from 2802 please do that, and share the file back to me!
